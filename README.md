# **YouTube Data Analysis and Success Prediction**
This is a personal project intended to just provide some insight to a friend of mine who has a good amount of following on her channel, but feel free to check around.

After performing some webscraping using the YouTube Data API, analytics will be performed to provide some insight on what variables are relative to video success (in terms of viewcount)

# **TO-DO's**
  - Finalize webscraper and output variables to a csv
  - Redevelop a new predictor model
